# Jeopardy-game


This game was made using the Jeopardy API, Jservice. It is a trivia game that you can play with family and friends. Some of the data on this API is missing either questions or values so the case is handled by a note advicing the client to move on to the next question. You can guess the answer and then check it, using the checkbox in the middle. You can add points and subtract points. Play the game the way you want! Have fun!
